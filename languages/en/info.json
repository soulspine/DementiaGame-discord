The game takes place in rounds, in which you can ask one question or guess who you are. If you guess correctly, you move on to the winners, if not, the round ends and the next patient asks a question or guesses. You try to cope with gradual memory loss, so in each round you can take notes with a question and answer. The game ends when everyone guesses who they are, the set limit of winners is reached or the majority of patients agree to it."
